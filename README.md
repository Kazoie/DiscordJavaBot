My first Java discord bot using JDA library

Actually providing those commands :
- /raider-io-character
- /mythicplus
- /guildtanking

These commands are using raider-io API to track the progression of a character or
a guild in the game "World of Warcraft" 

I'm currently working on those commands :
- /register
- /update
- /showgraph

The purpose of these commands is to provide a real time dataBase where you can
register some of your character from World of warcraft and see the progression of
their mythic+ score and show in into a graph

Thanks to Xemuth and TheCosmicStep for helping me when i had problems in the
development, without them it would have been way more difficult to me.
